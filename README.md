# electron_viewer_for_OBS_Browser

A lightweight Electron-based "browser source" window for OBS Studio.  
If your OBS installation doesnâ€™t have the built-in Browser Source feature, this app emulates it by creating an always-on-top, transparent window to display multiple web widgets, overlays, or alerts.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- Display multiple web sources in one transparent, draggable window.
- Saves window position and size between runs.
- Always-on-top for easy overlay use.
- Three display modes:
  1. **Framed look** (with draggable title bar)
  2. **Frameless look** (clean overlay)
  3. **Hidden**
- Simple configuration via config.json.
- Global shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + M to cycle modes.
